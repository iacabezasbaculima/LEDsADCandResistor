Developed for ARM board FRDM-KL25Z

Title: Use a Variable Resistor to Control the Flashes of an LED

Requirements implemented:
- Measure voltages using simple ended ADC conversion with a button press
- Determine time on and time off of blue LED
- Flash blue LED with maximum period (time on + time off)
- Allow to take subsequent measurements to change time on and time off
